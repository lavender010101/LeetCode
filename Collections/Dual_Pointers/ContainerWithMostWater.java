Description
   Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
   Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example-1

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can containÂ is 49.
```

class Solution {
	public int maxArea(int[] height) {
		int i = 0, j = height.length - 1;

		int ans = 0, area = 0;

		while (i < j) {
			if (height[i] < height[j]) {
				area = (j - i) * height[i];
				i++;
			} else {
				area = (j - i) * height[j];
				j--;
			}
			if (area > ans) {
				ans = area;
			}
		}

		return ans;
